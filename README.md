# Online-MDP
This work is based on the study of Large Scale Markov Decision Processes with Changing Rewards made by Cardoso A.R., Wang H. and Xu.
<br>
Markov Decision Processes provide a very useful framework for Decision Making under uncertainty.
<br>
MDPs can be combined with Online Convex Optimization to model situations where the agent is aware of the transition probabilities between states given the actions chosen, but where the rewards are selected dynamically by an adversary.
<br>
In this project we apply the approach used by the authors: which consists of using the Follow The Leader method to the dual form of the linear programming formulation of the MDP.
